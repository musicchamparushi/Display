Whatsapp-Chats-Display-on-PC
============================

This script is used to open whatsapp messages on your computer screen, just the way you see them on your mobile phone. 
Attempt has been made to create a similar display.
The messages will open in your browser.

You first need to email the whatsapp conversation from whatsapp to your email (with media attached).
Save the file with messages in your pc along with the media files, at the same location.
Now run the python script with a command line argument. This argument should be the path of directory in which you have saved the chat.

A few problems which remain are:
This has not been implemented for group chats.
Multiple lines messages sent by one person are displayed in an overlapping manner.
